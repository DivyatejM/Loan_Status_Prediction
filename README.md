# Loan Status Prediction

Machine learning model that predicts of a candidate's Loan should be approved or not.
<br><br>
There are various parameters that play an important role in the approval of loan like:<br>
    1. Applicant's Income.<br>
    2. Coappicant's Income.<br>
    3. Education Qualification.<br>
    4. Number of Dependents.<br>
    5. Maritial Status.<br>
    6. Credit History and more.<br>
<br>These parameters cannot be manually verified for individual candidates and analysis of different parameters can lead to some biases.<br>
Due to which a Model is prepared which takes in all the data and compares it with the data in the model and their outcomes <br>which not only automates the process but also reduce the biases.<br><br>
<br>
There were set of sub-tasks I performed inorder to finally prepare this Machine Learning Model:<br>
  *1. Data Collection<br>*
  *2. Data Analysis.<br>*
  *3. Data Visualization.*<br>
  *4. Data Cleaning.<br>*
  *5. Data Processing.<br>*
  *6. Modelling.<br>*
  <br>
  <br>
I used various Resampling Techniques to balance the data.<br>
Due to Skewness in the data, I performed some Data Transformation Techniques.<br>
<br> Performed Univariant & Bivariant Analysis to get better understanding.<br><br> 
Specifically, in the Modelling part. I utilized the ***Logistic Regression*** and the ***Gradient Boosting*** models.<br>
But the Gradient Boosting Model performed a little better than the Logistic Regression Model.
<br> Gradient Boosting model also gave good Cross Validation Score.
